# Welcome to YuJa Heaven!

This collection of lectures, meetings, and relevant third-party vieos uploaded by mostly-US institutions onto YuJa's cloud-storage program. A previous version of the database existed which only held ~35% of what was available. Remember kids: **security through obscurity is _not_ really security.** It's insecurity and conceitedness in disguise.

Run `sqlite.py` to generate a SQLite database (complete with views and schemas) that you can navigate through. You can also use Excel and make an access database with the available CSV files.
